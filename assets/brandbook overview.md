# UnuUnu Church Website Redesign - Agent Brief

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Complete design overhaul of the UnuUnu church portal (https://unu-unu-ro.github.io/) to align with the official brandbook guidelines.

**Primary Issue:** Current site overuses warm brown tones excessively, lacking the balanced, fresh approach defined in the brand identity.

**Goal:** Create a modern, welcoming website that properly implements the brand's color palette, typography, and visual system while maintaining the church's warm, friendly character without overwhelming users with brown.

## Brand Foundation

- **Tagline:** "Aproape de Dumnezeu, aproape de fiecare om" (Close to God, close to every person)
- **Purpose:** A bridge between "The One" Eternal and each individual on their journey to eternity

### Core Values

1. Biblical Teaching (Învățătură Biblică)
2. Evangelism & Discipleship (Evanghelizare și Ucenicie)

## Color System - CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

### Primary Colors (Use These Prominently)

- **Sunset:** `#AC5334` - Main brand color for backgrounds, CTAs, important elements
- **Sand:** `#E6D2B8` - Supporting color, pairs with Sunset
- **Wool:** `#F9F5F2` - Neutral, use for backgrounds, secondary buttons, logo overlays

### Secondary Colors (Introduce for Balance & Variety)

**Kids Department:**

- Sunrise: `#DBA111` (yellow)
- Glow: `#FAE6B2` (light yellow)

**Adolescents:**

- Pasture: `#63632E` (green)
- Olive: `#B7B59F` (light green)

**Youth:**

- Ocean: `#748EAA` (blue)
- Mist: `#D1D7E0` (light blue)

**Women:**

- Wine: `#593336` (purple)
- Fig: `#D7CBCC` (light purple)

**Men:**

- Stone: `#80756A` (warm gray)
- Rain: `#D1CCC7` (light gray)

### Color Strategy for Redesign

**PROBLEM:** Current site is dominated by Sunset/Sand brown tones everywhere.

**SOLUTION:**

1. Use **Wool (`#F9F5F2`)** as the primary background color for most sections
2. Reserve **Sunset (`#AC5334`)** for strategic accents: CTAs, headers, navigation highlights
3. Introduce **secondary colors** to create visual variety:
   - Ocean/Mist blues for sections about youth or peace/simplicity
   - Pasture/Olive greens for growth-focused content
   - Use department colors for their respective sections
4. Create breathing room with more white/Wool backgrounds
5. Use Sand sparingly as a subtle background variation, not everywhere
6. Leverage photography with proper overlays instead of solid color blocks

## Typography System

### Primary Font: Switzer (Sans-serif)

- **Switzer Regular:** Body text, general content
- **Switzer Medium:** Logo, emphasis
- **Usage:** Subheadings in ALL CAPS
- **Character:** Modern, simple, tall y-axis

### Secondary Font: Nyght Serif Regular Italic

- **Usage:** Emphasis on important words within Switzer text
- **Character:** Calligraphic, traditional, balances modern primary font
- **Rule:** Always paired with Switzer, never standalone for body text

### Typography Rules

- **Alignment:** Consistently centered OR left-aligned (never mixed, never right-aligned)
- **Hierarchy:** Logo should be smaller than headlines
- **Tone:** Natural, human-sounding, conversational

---

## Visual Identity

### Logo System

**Primary Logo:** Horizontal "UnuUnu" with logomark (for headers, wide spaces)

**Secondary Logo:** Vertical stacked version (for narrow spaces)

**Logomark:** The "11" forming a cross

**Logo Meaning:**

- Number 11: Church's identity as 11th planted in Cluj-Napoca
- Upright + upside-down 1: Creating cross shape
- Symbolizes: Vertical relationship with God + horizontal relationship with community

### Logo Usage Guidelines

✅ **DO:**

- Wool on Sunset background (or vice versa)
- Sunset on Sand background (or vice versa)
- Wool/white on photos with good contrast
- Paired secondary colors (Ocean + Mist, Pasture + Olive)

❌ **DON'T:**

- Outline the logo
- Stretch or compress
- Rotate the logo
- Use Wool on white (insufficient contrast)
- Change typeface (must be Switzer Medium + Nyght Serif Italic)
- Use low-contrast color combinations

### Minimum Sizes

- **Digital:** 22.7px height (primary), 8.5px height (secondary)
- **Logomark:** 7.9px height (primary), 8.5px height (secondary)

---

## Supporting Visual Elements

### Pattern

- Repeated logomark pattern with directional shifts
- Use Sunset 2 (`#A55032`) on Sunset background
- Apply **subtly** for texture, not dominantly

### Shapes

- **Octagon:** Derived from logo outline, rotated
- **Square & Circle:** Same proportions as octagon
- **Purpose:** Photo frames, graphic elements, social media

---

## Photography Guidelines

### Style Requirements

**Feeling:** Welcoming, calm, relatable

**Subjects:** Diverse ages and styles, natural interactions

**Avoid:** Stock photos (use real church community photos)

### Composition

- Show: setup, arrivals, worship, prayer, sermons, Sunday school, socializing
- Feature all members, not just stage performers

### Lighting

- Balanced vibrancy and contrast
- Natural light preferred
- Neutral to warm artificial light
- **Avoid cool-toned lighting**

## Final Notes

The key to this redesign is **balance**. The Sunset color is beautiful and represents warmth and welcome, but it should be an accent, not the foundation. Think of it like seasoning food—just enough to add flavor without overwhelming the dish.

Use the full color palette, leverage white space, and let the photography and typography create the warm, inviting atmosphere alongside (not buried under) the brand colors.

Remember: **Wool is your friend.** It's the neutral base that allows Sunset and the department colors to shine when used strategically.
